// Frames of input delay in character select, where the relay runs strict
// lockstep: nobody sees frame F until every player's input for F has arrived.
//
// This was a fixed 30 -- half a second between pressing a button and seeing the
// cursor move, for every player, on every connection. That is what testers
// described as "extremely laggy" with a single 40 ms player in the room: the
// network was never the problem. The delay only has to cover the round trip
// through the relay; 10 frames (~167 ms) does that for anyone under ~150 ms
// without the lockstep ever stalling. Set with the relay's third argument.
// Changing it mid-session is safe; changing it mid-SCENE is not, which is why
// it is only read once at startup.
unsigned characterInputDelay = 10;

// How many character-select frames the relay may run ahead of the slowest
// player's acknowledgement before it waits. Only a player whose round trip to
// the relay exceeds this many frames ever feels it: at 20 that is ~330 ms.
// Set with the relay's third argument.
unsigned chrSelectWindow = 20;

// How many character-select frames one reply may carry.
//
// THIS IS THE 4P CHARACTER-SELECT FREEZE. The game's input-packet codec works
// out of an 80-byte scratch buffer at netmanager+0x5bc: th123 pushes 0x50 as
// the serialisation limit in both directions, at 0x454d03 when a client sends
// and at 0x4559a4 when a vanilla host answers. Eight of those bytes are header,
// so the largest input packet the game ever produces -- or is built to read --
// holds 36 inputs.
//
// This relay was writing (lastFrame - frameId) * 4, and with a 30 frame delay
// and four players that is 124 inputs in a 256 byte datagram, on the FIRST
// packet after UNLOCK_CHAR_SELECT, every single time. The client does not
// advance on it. Its distribute loop at 0x454d30 needs `4 * frames <= queue
// size` and the queue it gets is not the 124 the packet declares, so the frame
// counter at netmanager+0x98 never moves, the same frame id goes back out, and
// the same oversized answer comes back forever. All four freeze together
// because character select is lockstep.
//
// It was invisible before all four seats could be filled: until then the relay
// takes the other branch and echoes the client's own count, which is 1.
//
// Nine frames would fit exactly. Eight is used because a reply only ever needs
// ONE: the frame id in it is always packet.frameId + 1, so the client advances
// a single frame per packet and reads only the first group. The rest is
// padding against nothing, and it is what broke this.

// leave here the instant they arrive, not when everyone agrees.
//
// So the server no longer parses, stores, reorders or gates battle inputs. It
// forwards the sender's datagram to the other players untouched. The payload is
// giuroll's, and deliberately opaque here: a relay that understood the rollback
// format would be a second implementation of it to keep in step with the first.
// The sender stamps its own slot, because only the client knows which seat it
// occupies from the join it was acked.

// Character select still goes through the old gated path, and should: it is a
// menu, lockstep costs nothing there, and it has no savestate to roll back to.

//
// This used to reflect each client's datagram verbatim to the other three.
// Verbatim means the sender's frame id, and the recipient's distribute loop
// measures every id against ITS counter -- see the renumbering comment in
// _handlePacketGame. Four free-running counters means every battle packet is
// rejected by everyone, so nobody ever leaves CBattleCL::onActivate.
//
// Reflection was also the wrong SHAPE. 4PSoku patches the distribute loop to
// stride 4 (main.cpp, TamperNearCall at 0x454d6a and pushOnlineInputs at
// 0x454da1): one packet is expected to carry all four players' input for a
// frame, which is what _handleChrSelectInput already builds. A reflected 1v1
// packet carries one player's, and the first peer to arrive would advance the
// counter past the other two.
//
// Answering packet.frameId + 1 needs no relay-side battle counter at all: the
// id a client sends IS the counter the reply is checked against, so the reply
// is self-synchronising and the delta is always exactly one frame -- four
// inputs, which is what the stride-4 gate asks for.
//
// No lockstep barrier here, unlike character select. Waiting on the slowest
// peer is the thing rollback exists to avoid, and with giuroll loaded these
// inputs are a keep-alive: the real ones travel as PACKET_ROLLBACK_INPUT,
// peer to peer where the mesh is up. They are still filled in rather than
// zeroed so a session without giuroll degrades to playable instead of inert.
